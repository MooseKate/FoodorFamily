Food or family? How gut microbes respond to diet and phylogeny in two deer species

Wild herbivores have a symbiotic relationship with the microbial community (microbiome) in their gastrointestinal tract. The animal provides habitat and food substrate for microbes and the microbes provide volatile fatty acids, amino acids, vitamins, and other essential nutrients for the herbivores. When different herbivore species live in the same habitats and consume the same diets, we would expect their microbiome to be similar. To examine this hypothesis, we compared the fecal microbiome between congeneric deer species—mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus) and white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) that were raised together in the same location and on the same maintenance diet and exposed to the same environments. We used 16S rRNA analyzed for microbial alpha-diversity and taxonomic richness. We found significant differences in the composition of the microbiome between the deer species and characterized how it changed as deer transitioned from pelleted maintenance diet to a completely natural diet and back again over a 3 month period. The top 10 identified orders were also distinct between the two species and aligned with the putative nutrient selection described for each species. Our findings suggest that physiological differences in the gastrointestinal tract that influence the microbiome may drive differences in diets consumed and extraction of nutrients from these diets between the deer species.
